This is my personal website where you can find link to my blog posts and other useful resources and notes.

Please do not fork this repo, as it contains some configuration values that are very specific to my site. If you want to have a similar site then use [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).
